Native C implementation for the I\+L\+I934\+X series of L\+C\+D drivers. This driver is designed to implement all functionality of the I\+L\+I934\+X display driver for use with A\+V\+R based projects. The driver is still a W\+I\+P and not all features are completed. The driver provides a set of simple functions for draweing various types of objects to the screen that can be used in conjunction with my A\+V\+R Graphics 2\+D Library to build more complex shapes.

I have tried to implement the library in a lightweight fashion and the footprint of the library alone is extremely small.

More documentation will be added as the library develops.

\subsection*{A\+P\+I/\+Documentation }

Documentation is now provided via the automatically generated doxygen site, as well as by the doxygen generated La\+Te\+X manual. The site is available on the \href{http://flungo-avr.github.io/ili934x-driver/}{\tt gh-\/pages site} for this repository or by downloading the \href{https://github.com/flungo-avr/ili934x-driver/tree/gh-pages}{\tt gh-\/pages branch}. The La\+Te\+X version of this documentation is currently only available by downloading and compiling yourself from the \href{https://github.com/flungo-avr/ili934x-driver/tree/latex}{\tt latex branch}. I hope to have this automatically made and published with continuous integration and to publish it with a packaged version of the library at incremental stages.

\subsection*{Usage }

\subsubsection*{Compatability/\+Constraints}

This library is designed for use with A\+V\+R that support extended memory interface with 10 bit addressing connected to the I\+L\+I934\+X driver via an 8 bit parrallel data bus. This is not planned to be customisable in the forseable future but may be part of the long term roadmap to implement S\+P\+I and 16/18bit bus support.

\subsubsection*{Configuration}

To configure, you will need to have a file names {\ttfamily ili934x\+\_\+conf.\+h} in your build path. A sample of this is provided as {\ttfamily \hyperlink{ili934x__conf_8sample_8h_source}{ili934x\+\_\+conf.\+sample.\+h}}. Configuration is made by defining macros for settings that will enable or disable features.

The configuration options currently include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries I\+L\+I934\+X\+\_\+\+B\+L\+C\+\_\+\+P\+I\+N} -\/ The backlight pin used for the L\+C\+D Driver, currently assumed to be on {\ttfamily P\+O\+R\+T\+B}
\item {\bfseries I\+L\+I934\+X\+\_\+\+R\+E\+S\+E\+T\+\_\+\+P\+I\+N} -\/ The reset pin used for the L\+C\+D Driver, currently assumed to be on {\ttfamily P\+O\+R\+T\+C}
\item {\bfseries I\+L\+I934\+X\+\_\+\+C\+M\+D\+\_\+\+A\+D\+D\+R} -\/ The address to write 8 bit commands to that will be sent to the L\+C\+D Driver via the extended memory interface
\item {\bfseries I\+L\+I934\+X\+\_\+\+D\+A\+T\+A\+\_\+\+A\+D\+D\+R} -\/ The address to write data (command parameters) to that will be sent to the L\+C\+D Driver via the extended memory interface
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Libraries }

This driver is designed to be expanded with the use of additional libraries to provide the functionality you need. Libraries which I have created for use with this driver include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries A\+V\+R L\+C\+D Text Library} -\/ A library to provide text output to the display in a variety of fonts and styles
\item {\bfseries A\+V\+R L\+C\+D Graphics 2\+D Library} -\/ A library to aid with the drawing of 2\+D graphics in an efficient manner
\item {\bfseries A\+V\+R L\+C\+D Graphing Library} -\/ A library to plot various types of graphs
\end{DoxyItemize}

All the libraries are designed to be used as widgets to provide compatability between each other.

\subsubsection*{Planned Libraries}
